                This is the legal text about sending me ideas. In short, it states that when you send me an idea, I can use that idea, and you consent to let me use it.
                <br>
                This legal notice is needed due to “intellectual property”. Many people and companies have faced litigation because they came up with, or were already working on, an idea that was coincidentally similar to one sent in by a member of the public.
                <br>
                For safety, here's my policy on that.
